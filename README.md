# qpb_data_analysis

A Python-based toolkit for analyzing log files and data files generated by the
'qpb' project. This repository provides scripts for processing and visualizing
data, with outputs in CSV, HDF5, and image formats. It includes modular
libraries, usage examples, and unit tests to ensure reliability and ease of use.

## Project Structure
<!-- TODO: List the project structure -->

### Key Directories

#### `qpb_data_analysis/`
This is the main Python package and contains:
- **`library/`**: Reusable modules for tasks like file handling, calculations,
  and more.
- **`src/`**: Scripts for data processing, analysis, and plotting.
- **`unit_tests/`**: Test suite for validating functionality. Includes a
  `mock_data/` subdirectory for sample data.

#### `docs/`
Documentation for users, including setup instructions, data file organization
guidelines, and more.

#### `data_files/`
Stores input and output data:
- `raw/`: Unprocessed data.
- `processed/`: Cleaned or transformed data.

### Setup Scripts

#### `setup.py`
Standard Python packaging script. Use this to install the project as a Python
package.

**Usage:**
```bash
pip install -e .
```

#### `setup.sh`
Bash script for setting up the project environment. It handles:  
* Installing Python dependencies from requirements.txt.
* Setting up environment variables or directory structures as needed.

**Usage:**
```bash
bash setup.sh
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:  
```
git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/qpb_data_analysis.git
cd qpb_data_analysis
```

2. Install Python dependencies:  
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Optionally, run the setup script for additional configuration:
```
bash setup.sh
```

### Usage

* Data Processing: Scripts in `src/` handle raw-to-processed data transformations.
* Data Analysis: Analyze simulation outputs using scripts in `src/`.
* Plotting: Generate visualizations with plotting scripts in `src/`.

**Example:**  
```
python qpb_data_analysis/src/process_data.py --input data_files/raw/example.csv --output data_files/processed/output.csv
```

### Testing

Unit tests are located in qpb_data_analysis/unit_tests/. To run tests:
```
pytest qpb_data_analysis/unit_tests/
```
