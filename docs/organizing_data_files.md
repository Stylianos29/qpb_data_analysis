# Organizing Data Files for `qpb_data_analysis`

This guide provides detailed suggestions for organizing the `data_files/raw` and
`data_files/processed` directories to ensure consistency, ease of access, and
clarity.

---

## Directory Structure

We recommend structuring the data files under the following hierarchy:

data_files/ ├── raw/ │ ├── <qpb_main_program>/ │ │ ├── <project_name>/ │ │ │ ├──
file1.log │ │ │ ├── file2.dat │ │ │ └── ... ├── processed/ │ ├──
<qpb_main_program>/ │ │ ├── <project_name>/ │ │ │ ├── output1.csv │ │ │ ├──
output2.h5 │ │ │ ├── plot1.jpg │ │ │ └── ...


### Explanation of Components
- `<qpb_main_program>`: The name of the main `qpb` program that produced the
  data files. Examples:
  - `qpb_project_1`
  - `qpb_project_2`

- `<project_name>`: A unique name or identifier for the specific simulation,
  analysis, or experiment. Examples:
  - `simulation_123`
  - `experiment_alpha`

## Guidelines for `data_files/raw`

1. **Purpose**: Store raw data files exactly as they are generated by the `qpb`
   program. Do not modify these files.
   
2. **Recommended File Types**:
   - `.log` files: Logs of program execution.
   - `.dat` files: Raw data files outputted by simulations.

3. **Example**: data_files/raw/qpb_project_1/simulation_123/ ├── simulation.log
├── results.dat └── parameters.txt

4. **Best Practices**:
- Avoid storing processed or manually modified files in this directory.
- Use descriptive filenames whenever possible to make file identification
  easier.

## Guidelines for `data_files/processed`

1. **Purpose**: Store files generated after processing raw data using the
`qpb_data_analysis` scripts.

2. **Recommended File Types**:
- `.csv`: Data tables suitable for analysis in spreadsheet software or further
  scripting.
- `.h5`: HDF5 files for efficient storage of large datasets.
- `.jpg` or `.png`: Plots and visualizations created during analysis.

3. **Example**: data_files/processed/qpb_project_1/simulation_123/ ├──
summary.csv ├── processed_data.h5 ├── histogram.jpg └── trends.png

4. **Best Practices**:
- Keep files grouped by `<qpb_main_program>` and `<project_name>` for
  consistency.
- Ensure file names describe their content, e.g., `summary.csv` or
  `plot_trends.png`.
- Avoid storing temporary or intermediary files unless absolutely necessary.

## General Notes

1. **Cross-referencing**:
- Always link raw data files with their corresponding processed files using
  directory and file naming conventions.

2. **Backup and Archival**:
- Consider backing up raw data files to avoid accidental loss.
- Archive older processed files to save space and maintain clarity.

3. **Collaboration**:
- When sharing the repository, ensure all contributors adhere to these
  organizational guidelines for consistency.

4. **Versioning**:
- If reanalyzing data under different conditions, use separate subdirectories
  for each version of processed files.

## Troubleshooting

1. **Misplaced Files**: If you find files in incorrect directories, move them
promptly to maintain organization.

2. **File Name Conflicts**: Use unique names for files to avoid overwriting.
Include timestamps or unique identifiers when needed:

results_2024_11_20.csv

3. **Missing Files**: Always check that all required raw files exist before
starting analysis. Consider creating a script to validate file presence.

the individual README files in the `data_files/raw` and `data_files/processed`
directories.

Happy analyzing!
