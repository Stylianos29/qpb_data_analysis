# Raw Data Files Directory

This directory is intended to store raw data files generated by main programs of
the [qpb project](https://github.com/g-koutsou/qpb). Follow these guidelines to
organize your files properly:

## Organization

- Place files under directories structured as:
  <qpb_main_program>/<experiment_name>/

  For example:
  - invert/Chebyshev_several_N_and_m_varying_EpsCG/
  - sign_squared_violation/KL_several_vectors_varying_configs_and_n/

- Avoid storing unrelated files here to maintain clarity and organization.

## File Types

- The raw data files here should be in their original format as outputted by the
  `qpb` program.
- Examples of raw data formats include:
- `.txt` files
- `.dat` files

## Additional Notes

For more detailed instructions and conventions, refer to the [Organizing Data
Files documentation](../../docs/organizing_data_files.md).
