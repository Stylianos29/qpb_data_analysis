# Raw Data Files Directory

This directory is intended to store raw data files produced by the main program
`qpb`. Follow these guidelines to organize your files properly:

## Organization

- Place files under directories structured as:
<qpb_main_program>/<project_name>/ For example: qpb_project_1/simulation_123/
qpb_project_2/simulation_456/

- Avoid storing unrelated files here to maintain clarity and organization.

## File Types

- The raw data files here should be in their original format as outputted by the
  `qpb` program.
- Examples of raw data formats include:
- `.log` files
- `.dat` files

## Additional Notes

For more detailed instructions and conventions, refer to the [Organizing Data
Files documentation](../../docs/organizing_data_files.md).
