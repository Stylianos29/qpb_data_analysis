# Processed Data Files Directory

This directory is intended to store processed data files generated after running
the `qpb_data_analysis` scripts. Follow these guidelines to keep your files
organized:

## Organization

- Place files under directories structured as:
<qpb_main_program>/<project_name>/ For example: qpb_project_1/simulation_123/
qpb_project_2/simulation_456/

## File Types

- The processed data files typically include:
- `.csv` files
- `.h5` files (HDF5 format)
- `.jpg` or `.png` plot images

## Additional Notes

For more detailed instructions and conventions, refer to the [Organizing Data
Files documentation](../../docs/organizing_data_files.md).
